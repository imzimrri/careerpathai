# Story 1.1: Implement Frontend UI

- **Status:** Done

## Story

- **As a** user,
- **I want** to input my Current Role and my Target Role,
- **so that** the system can understand my career change goal.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The user can see an input field for "Current Role".
2. The user can see an input field for "Target Role".
3. The user can see a "Generate Path" button.
4. The button is disabled if either input field is empty.
5. Clicking the button (when enabled) triggers an API call.
6. A loading indicator is displayed while the API call is in progress.
7. An error message is displayed if the API call fails.
8. The results from a successful API call are displayed in a formatted way.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3):** Create the main `CareerPathGenerator.jsx` component with two text inputs and a button, styled with Bootstrap.
- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 4, 5, 6):** Implement component state using `useState` for input fields, loading status, and errors. Add the form submission handler.
- [x] **Task 3 (AC: 5):** Create the `services/api.js` file and implement the `generateCareerPath` function that calls the backend API. For now, it can expect a mock response.
- [x] **Task 4 (AC: 7, 8):** Implement the UI to display the loading spinner, handle and display errors, and render the results from a successful (mocked) API call.

## Dev Notes

- **Tech Stack:** React, Vite, Bootstrap 5. [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Component Structure:** Create components under `frontend/src/components/`. The main component is `CareerPathGenerator.jsx`. [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]
- **State Management:** Use local component state with `useState` hooks only. [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]
- **API Client:** Create a service function in `frontend/src/services/api.js` to encapsulate the `fetch` call to `POST /api/generate-career-path`. [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]
- **Data Models:** The component should be prepared to display the `CareerPath` data model received from the API. [Source: architecture.md#data-models]
- **Testing:** No automated testing is required for the MVP. Manual testing of the happy path and error states is sufficient. [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
